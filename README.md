3. We require 90% testing coverage, your check with `yarn test:coverage`
4. Make and commit your changes following the commit convention.
   - `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features
   - `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an issue if present)
   - `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
   - `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for usage of a lib or cli usage)
   - `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
