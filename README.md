# Restaurant Club shared component frontend

In this repo will live the components that will be shared between all the project.
The suggested structure is:

```
baseSharedStyle.sass
{ComponentName}
-> index.ts
-> stlye.sass
-> useComponentName.ts => custom hook contain the component logic
```

The js & css files should be modified to TS & SCSS when all the projects are migrated.
